# Patient-Management-System
This repo has Patient Management System which was developed using Data Structures and Algorithms

Healthcare is the major sector to focus on in this modern era. So there is utmost need to have a 
patient management system which manages the patients and their appointments. In this Project Patients will 
have their respective appointment dates and timings with various priorities acc to pregnancy, disability,
age etc factors. The patient who has an earlier appointment date and time will be placed before.

The patients will be listed according to their appointment first and their priority conditions
after that: 

  | Condition  | Priority |
  | Disabled   | 5        |
  | Over 65    | 4        |
  | Pregnant   | 3        |
  | Under 18   | 2        |
  | Regular    | 1        |
  
  5 means the highest priority, 1 means the lowest priority.
